# LangGraph Implementation for Gemini Function Calling

This document explains the implementation of LangGraph in the `tech_implement/tools/agent.py` file to execute function calls with the Gemini model.

## Overview

The implementation replaces the original manual loop-based function calling approach with a structured LangGraph workflow that provides better control, state management, and debugging capabilities.

## Key Components

### 1. State Management

```python
class AgentState(TypedDict):
    """State for the LangGraph agent"""
    messages: List[Dict[str, Any]]
    user_prompt: str
    final_response: str
    iteration_count: int
```

The state tracks:

- **messages**: Conversation history between user, model, and tools
- **user_prompt**: Original user input
- **final_response**: Final processed response
- **iteration_count**: Number of iterations for debugging

### 2. Graph Structure

The LangGraph workflow consists of three main nodes:

#### `generate_response`

- Sends requests to Gemini model
- Handles conversation context and tool definitions
- Adds model responses to state

#### `execute_tools`

- Detects function calls in model responses
- Executes corresponding calculator functions
- Formats tool responses for the model

#### `finalize`

- Extracts final text response from conversation
- Handles fallback cases

### 3. Control Flow

```
Entry → generate_response → [conditional] → execute_tools → generate_response
                         → [conditional] → finalize → END
```

The conditional logic determines whether to:

- Execute tools (if function calls are detected)
- Finalize response (if no function calls)

## Key Improvements

### 1. Better Error Handling

- Structured exception handling in tool execution
- Clear error messages for debugging
- Graceful fallbacks for missing tools

### 2. State Persistence

- Complete conversation history maintained
- Iteration tracking for debugging
- Clean separation of concerns

### 3. Debugging Capabilities

- Extensive logging with emoji indicators
- Step-by-step execution visibility
- Clear indication of tool execution results

### 4. Modular Design

- Separate nodes for different responsibilities
- Reusable components
- Easy to extend with additional tools

## Function Response Format

The calculator functions were updated to return dictionary responses:

```python
def add(self, a, b):
    print(f"Adding {a} and {b}")
    return {"result": a + b}  # Dictionary format required by Gemini API
```

This ensures compatibility with the Gemini API's function response validation.

## Usage

```python
from tech_implement.tools.agent import Agent

# Create agent instance
agent = Agent()

# Execute with function calls
result = agent.call_agent("What is 15 + 27?")
print(result)  # Output: "The sum of 15 and 27 is 42."
```

## Benefits of LangGraph Implementation

1. **Structured Workflow**: Clear separation of generation, execution, and finalization phases
2. **Better Debugging**: Comprehensive logging and state tracking
3. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new nodes or modify the workflow
4. **Error Recovery**: Robust error handling with meaningful feedback
5. **State Management**: Proper conversation context maintenance
6. **Performance**: Efficient handling of multiple function calls in sequence

## Testing

The implementation successfully handles:

- Single function calls (simple addition)
- Multiple sequential operations
- Complex multi-tool scenarios
- Error conditions and recovery

Example test results:

- ✅ "What is 15 + 27?" → "The sum of 15 and 27 is 42."
- ✅ Complex multi-step calculations with multiple tools
- ✅ Random number generation with specified ranges

## Dependencies

- `langgraph`: Core workflow management
- `google-genai`: Gemini API integration
- `typing_extensions`: Type hints support

The implementation maintains backward compatibility with the existing `Agent` class interface.
